Description: Cloth Simulation Filter (CSF) is an airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) ground 
    points filtering algorithm  which is based on cloth simulation. It tries to simulate the interactions
    between the cloth nodes and the corresponding LiDAR points, the locations of the cloth nodes can be
    determined to generate an approximation of the ground surface <https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/6/501/htm>.
